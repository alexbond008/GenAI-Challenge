## Introduction
In this JAM session, we will explore the exciting world of Generative AI and its
applications. In this session, we will be focusing on the use of Gen AI in the world of 
building, testing, and deploying applications.

Your session today will comprise of a series of challenges that will address different capabilities of Generative AI.

Your instructor will guide you through the challenges and provide you with the necessary resources and support to complete them successfully.

Each challenge can be found in a subfolder in the this Git repository.

## Pre-requisites
In order to complete this session, you will need to have the following:
- The ability to clone this repository to the machine you are using for the JAM session
- The ability to install and run different tools and applications (if you are using one of our VMs, then these will be pre-installed)
- Access to at least one Developer centric GenAI tool such as Github CoPilot, SourceGraph Cody, or Amazon Q. 

## Project Teams - Playing to win or playing to learn?

You will be placed into groups of 3-4 people. This will be done relatively quickly, so please be prepared to work with people you don't know. Points will be awarded for each challenge that you complete. You can decide as a project team whether you want to work to win, or work to learn. You will learn either way, but your approach to the session will be different if you are just trying to win, vs, wanting to just learn together. There is no right or wrong approach, just different approaches. You will need to decide as a team which approach you want to take.

## Structure of the Day

Your instructor will guide you through the challenges and provide you with the necessary resources and support to complete them successfully. However, for those of you who would appreciate a heads up, the rough plan will be as follows:
