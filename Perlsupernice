Introduction Many of the apps found in a lot of large corporations, especially financial corporation are written in Perl. Perl is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in various domains, including web development, system administration, and data analysis.

However, Perl has some limitations that can make it challenging to maintain and upgrade. One of the most significant challenges is the lack of a comprehensive testing framework. Without proper testing, it can be difficult to ensure that the code is working as expected and to identify and fix any issues that may arise.

For this reason, and many others, Perl is often considered a legacy language, and many organizations are looking to migrate their Perl code to a more modern language.

Your task is to take the Perl code in this folder and upgrade it to a Python version.

The Challenge First, you will need to work out what this code actually does. Then, you will need to create a Python version of the code that does the same thing. The Python version should be written in a way that is easy to maintain and upgrade. There should also be e a set of tests that can be run to ensure that the code is working as expected.

Your solution to this challenge will be marked on the following criteria: - The code is written to modern Python standards. - Your code works! - You have created a set of comprehensive unit tests that can be run to ensure that the code is working as expected.

Points 500 points

Mark Scheme 400 points - a complete Python implementation of the required application written to a professional standard following modern pythonic coding standards 100 points - you can explain to the instructor to their satisfaction how the Perl application worked and how the new Python application has mirrored the functionality.

please refer to this task desc, make this code readable and explain to me what this code in perl does. i have no understanding of perl at all too

Of course. Let's break down the Perl script and then provide a modern Python equivalent.

What the Perl Script Does
This Perl script is a classic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool. Its job is to read data from a CSV file (prices.csv) and convert it into a set of SQL commands to create a database table and populate it with that data.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of its logic:

Extract: It opens and reads the prices.csv file.
Transform (Schema Generation):
It reads the first line of the CSV, assuming it's the header row with column names.
It "cleans" these column names by removing quotes and replacing spaces with underscores (_).
It then peeks at the first data row to guess the data type for each column. If a value contains letters, it assumes the type is VARCHAR(255); otherwise, it assumes FLOAT.
Using the cleaned column names and the inferred data types, it constructs a single CREATE TABLE SQL statement.
Transform (Data Insertion):
It processes the remaining rows in the CSV file one by one.
For each row, it constructs an INSERT INTO ... VALUES ... SQL statement.
It performs minor data cleaning, such as escaping single quotes and replacing empty values with 0.
Load:
It writes the generated CREATE TABLE statement into a new file named mysqlCreateSchema.sql.
It writes all the generated INSERT statements into a new file named mysqlInsertValues.sql.
In short, the script automates the process of creating a database schema and insertion script from a CSV file.

Python Implementation
Here is a modern, readable, and maintainable Python version that replicates the functionality of the Perl script. This code uses Python's built-in csv module for safer and more reliable file parsing and is structured into functions for clarity.

Of course. I have completed the main function in perlcode.py to correctly process all rows from the input CSV file.
