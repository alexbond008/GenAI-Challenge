Proposed fix: defer (code‑split) and lower the priority of rendering the heavy Credits component so the menu (in PageHeader) stays responsive. Root cause: the synchronous work inside Credits blocks the main thread when it is imported/rendered, freezing navigation. By lazy loading with React.lazy, showing a lightweight fallback, and wrapping the toggle in startTransition, navigation updates remain responsive while the credits load.

Apply this change to AboutPage:

import {useState, lazy, Suspense, useTransition} from "react";
// ...existing code...
// REMOVE the direct import of Credits:
// import Credits from "../credits/Credits";
// Lazy load to avoid blocking main bundle & allow concurrent rendering.
const Credits = lazy(() => import("../credits/Credits"));

const AboutPage = () => {

    const [showCredits, setShowCredits] = useState(false);
    const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

    const handleClick = () => {
        // Mark rendering of heavy Credits as a low‑priority transition
        startTransition(() => {
            setShowCredits(prev => !prev);
        });
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>About Page</h1>
            <p>This is the payments app</p>
            <button onClick={handleClick} disabled={isPending}>
                {showCredits ? "hide" : "show"} credits {isPending && '…'}
            </button>
            {showCredits && (
                <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading credits…</div>}>
                    <Credits />
                </Suspense>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}

export default AboutPage;
// ...existing code...

Explanation (concise):

Heavy synchronous work in Credits blocks the main thread during render/import, freezing UI.
Lazy loading (React.lazy) moves that work into a separate chunk, preventing it from blocking initial page load and only executing when needed.
startTransition (React concurrent rendering) marks the state change that triggers the heavy component as low priority so user interactions (like clicking menu links handled above in the tree) can proceed first.
Suspense shows a lightweight fallback while the heavy module resolves, keeping the header interactive.
No change to the intentional delay line inside Credits, satisfying the constraint.
Result: Menu navigation remains responsive while credits are being prepared/displayed.

Applied improvements for broader responsiveness: route-level code splitting + memoized header. Existing AboutPage fix retained.

import './App.css'
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'
import { Suspense, lazy } from 'react'
import PageHeader from './pageHeader/PageHeader'

// Lazy load pages so heavy code (incl. AboutPage -> Credits) does not block initial render
const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./homePage/HomePage'))
const AboutPage = lazy(() => import('./aboutPage/AboutPage'))
const FindTransaction = lazy(() => import('./transactionsManagement/FindTransaction'))
const AddTransaction = lazy(() => import('./transactionsManagement/AddTransaction'))

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <PageHeader />
      <Suspense fallback={<div style={{padding:16}}>Loading…</div>}>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
          <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
          <Route path="/find" element={<FindTransaction />} />
          <Route path="/add" element={<AddTransaction />} />
        </Routes>
      </Suspense>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}

export default App
import React from 'react'
import Menu from './Menu';
import './pageHeader.css';
import {Link} from "react-router-dom";

const PageHeader = React.memo(function PageHeader() {
    return (
        <div className="pageHeader">
            <h1><Link to="/">Demo Application</Link></h1>
            <Menu/>
        </div>
    );
});

export default PageHeader
No change needed to AboutPage (already using lazy + startTransition + Suspense).

Result:

Header renders immediately and stays interactive.
Page content (including Credits path) loads asynchronously without blocking navigation.
startTransition keeps menu responsive while toggling credits.
If further lag persists, share Credits.tsx so its internal work (except the mandated delay line) can be shifted into an effect or worker without violating constraints. Let me know if you want that.
